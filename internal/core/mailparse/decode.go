// Everything in this file answers one question: what do these bytes say?
//
// A message states its own encoding three separate times and in three
// different vocabularies - Content-Transfer-Encoding wraps the octets,
// a charset parameter says how to read them as text, and RFC 2047
// encoded words do both again inside a single header value. A parse that
// skips any one of them produces a string that looks like text and is
// not, which then travels all the way to somebody's screen.

// unwrapTransfer undoes Content-Transfer-Encoding.
//
// Only base64 and quoted-printable are transformations. The rest name
// how the octets were SAFE to send, not how they were changed, so they
// come back untouched - as does an encoding this does not know, since
// handing the raw bytes on is strictly better than refusing the message.
